# enigma-backend
This repository will contain the backend logic of our application in JAVA.

This application's aim is to provide funding to any Idea or Project if it is considered worth it by the users. Once it is accepted by its users then that Idea will be sent to all the VC’s to consider and then the VC’s can decide on which Idea(s) they want to fund. This way we will be able to connect Ideas to VC’s and actually convert Ideas into a startup or atleast a prototype.
